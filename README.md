PerkinElmer Operetta Importer Command and API
======================================

This is a (beta) new and improved version of the original Operetta Importer Script we had writted in Groovy a couple of years ago.

## Features

Its is now a clear(ish) API and a nice SciJava `InteractiveCommand`

We are looking for people to test it, so feel free to drop @lacan a line!

## Setup for testing
You can install our test update site for now:

From Fiji, go to Help > Update > Manage Update Sites

Select `Manage Update Sites`

Click on "Add update site"

in the URL column, enter `https://biop.epfl.ch/sites/operetta/`

in the Name column, name it BIOP Operetta Importer

That should be it
