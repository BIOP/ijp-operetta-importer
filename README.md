PerkinElmer Operetta Improter Command and API
======================================

This is a (beta) new and improved version of the original Operetta Importer Script we had writted in Groovy a couple of years ago.

## Features

Its is now a clear(ish) API and a nice SciJava `InteractiveCommand`

We are looking for people to test it, so feel free to drop @lacan a line!
