PerkinElmer Operetta Importer Command and API
======================================

This is a (beta) new and improved version of the original Operetta Importer Script we had writted in Groovy a couple of years ago.

## Features

Its is now a clear(ish) API and a nice SciJava `InteractiveCommand`

We are looking for people to test it, so feel free to drop @lacan a line!

## Documentation

We are hosting the JavaDoc as GitHub pages at https://biop.github.io/ijp-operetta-importer/

If you'd like to see some examples on how it can be used, please check the **Scripts** folder. This contains a few Groovy examples on how to call the Operetta Importer API
